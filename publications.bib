  abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium bovis, continues to cause significant issues for the global agriculture industry as well as for human health. An incomplete understanding of the host immune response contributes to the challenges of control and eradication of this zoonotic disease. In this study, high-throughput bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to characterize differential gene expression in γδ T cells – a subgroup of T cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunity and have known anti-mycobacterial response mechanisms. γδ T cell subsets are classified based on expression of a pathogen-recognition receptor known as Workshop Cluster 1 (WC1) and we hypothesised that bTB disease may alter the phenotype and function of specific γδ T cell subsets. Peripheral blood was collected from naturally M. bovis-infected (positive for single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) and IFN-γ ELISA) and age- and sex-matched, non-infected control Holstein-Friesian cattle. γδ T subsets were isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting (n = 10–12 per group) and high-quality RNA extracted from each purified lymphocyte subset (WC1.1+, WC1.2+, WC1- and γδ-) was used to generate transcriptomes using bulk RNA-seq (n = 6 per group, representing a total of 48 RNA-seq libraries). Relatively low numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed between most cell subsets; however, 189 genes were significantly differentially expressed in the M. bovis-infected compared to the control groups for the WC1.1+ γδ T cell compartment (absolute log2 FC ≥ 1.5 and FDR Padj. ≤ 0.1). The majority of these DEGs (168) were significantly increased in expression in cells from the bTB+ cattle and included genes encoding transcription factors (TBX21 and EOMES), chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CCR7), granzymes (GZMA, GZMM, and GZMH) and multiple killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) proteins indicating cytotoxic functions. Biological pathway overrepresentation analysis revealed enrichment of genes with multiple immune functions including cell activation, proliferation, chemotaxis, and cytotoxicity of lymphocytes. In conclusion, WC1.1+ γδ T cells have been proposed as major regulatory cell subset in cattle, and we provide evidence for preferential differential activation of this specific subset in cattle naturally infected with M. bovis.},

In the present study we have used genome-wide SNP data (Illumina® BovineSNP50 array) to evaluate genomic diversity within the Kerry cattle population and between Kerry cattle and other European cattle breeds. Visualisation of patterns of genetic differentiation and gene flow among cattle breeds using phylogenetic trees with ancestry graphs highlighted, in particular, historical gene flow from the British Shorthorn breed into the ancestral population of modern Kerry cattle. Principal component analysis (PCA) and genetic clustering emphasised the genetic distinctiveness of Kerry cattle relative to comparator British and European cattle breeds. Modelling of genetic effective population size (Ne) revealed a demographic trend of diminishing Ne over time and that recent estimated Ne values for the Kerry breed may be less than the threshold for sustainable genetic conservation. In addition, analysis of genome-wide autozygosity (FROH) showed that genomic inbreeding has increased significantly during the 20 years between 1992 and 2012. Finally, signatures of selection revealed genomic regions subject to natural and artificial selection as Kerry cattle adapted to the climate, physical geography and agro-ecology of southwest Ireland.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis is an infectious disease of increasing importance in humans and cattle, causing significant mortality, morbidity, and economic loss worldwide. The rise of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is of particular concern. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the primary cause of human TB) and Mycobacterium bovis (the primary cause of bovine TB) are remarkably similar at the genome sequence level. In the face of this, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning host responses to infection with these pathogens. This will have implications for diagnosis, vaccinology, and treatment of human TB and for disease control and management of bovine TB. In the present study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within active functional modules (subnetworks) were analysed. These DEGs were identified using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of human and bovine alveolar macrophages (hAM and bAM) 24 hours post infection (hpi) with M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, respectively. Following this, Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®) was used to systematically extract enriched molecular pathways involved in host responses to infection. Table 1 shows an overview of some of the key findings in this study. The results were multifaceted and complex and encompassed many aspects of host-pathogen interactions, including pathogen recognition, cell signalling and downstream inflammatory processes. This study provides further evidence to help frame future research questions that will be vital to developing a complete understanding of host-pathogen interactions for pathogenic mycobacterial infections of humans and cattle.},

  abstract = {Bovine TB (BTB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium bovis, is a major endemic disease affecting global cattle production. The key innate immune cell that first encounters the pathogen is the alveolar macrophage, which we have previously shown to be substantially reprogrammed during intracellular infection by M. bovis. In the current study we used differential expression with correlation- and interaction-based network approaches to analyze the macrophage transcriptional response to infection with M. bovis to identify core infection response pathways and gene modules. These outputs were then integrated with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets to enhance detection of genomic variants for susceptibility/resistance to M. bovis infection. The host gene expression data consisted of bovine RNA-seq data from alveolar macrophages infected with M. bovis at 24 and 48 h post-infection. These RNA-seq data were analyzed using 3 distinct analysis pipelines; novel response pathways and modules were further refined using cross-comparison and integration of the results. First, a differential expression analysis was carried out to determine the most significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes between conditions at each time point. Second, 2 networks were constructed at each time point using gene correlation patterns to determine changes in expression across conditions. Functional sub-modules within each correlation network were selected by statistical criteria for modularity. Third, a gene interaction base network of the mammalian host response to mycobacterial infection was generated using the GeneCards database (www.genecards.com) and InnateDB (www.innatedb.com). Differential gene expression data were superimposed on this base network to extract functional modules of interconnected DE genes. Bovine GWAS data were obtained from a published BTB susceptibility/resistance study. The results from the 3 parallel analyses were integrated with this data to determine which of the 3 approaches identified genes significantly enriched for SNPs associated with susceptibility/resistance to M. bovis infection. Our results indicate distinct and significant overlap in SNP discovery and demonstrate that network-based integration of relevant transcriptomics data can leverage substantial additional information from GWAS data sets.},

Results: The host gene expression data consisted of RNA-seq data from bovine alveolar macrophages (bAM) infected with M. bovis at 24 and 48\,h post-infection (hpi) compared to non-infected control bAM. These RNA-seq data were analysed using three distinct computational pipelines to produce six separate gene sets: 1) DE genes filtered using stringent fold-change and P-value thresholds (DEG-24: 378 genes, DEG-48: 390 genes); 2) genes obtained from expression correlation networks (CON-24: 460 genes, CON-48: 416 genes); and 3) genes obtained from differential expression networks (DEN-24: 339 genes, DEN-48: 495 genes). These six gene sets were integrated with three bTB breed GWAS data sets by employing a new genomics data integration tool—gwinteR. Using GWAS summary statistics, this methodology enabled detection of 36, 102 and 921 prioritised SNPs for Charolais, Limousin and Holstein-Friesian, respectively. Conclusions: The results from the three parallel analyses showed that the three computational approaches could identify genes significantly enriched for SNPs associated with susceptibility/resistance to M. bovis infection. Results indicate distinct and significant overlap in SNP discovery, demonstrating that network-based integration of biologically relevant transcriptomics data can leverage substantial additional information from GWAS data sets. These analyses also demonstrated significant differences among breeds, with the Holstein-Friesian breed GWAS proving most useful for prioritising SNPS through data integration. Because the functional genomics data were generated using bAM from this population, this suggests that the genomic architecture of bTB resilience traits may be more breed-specific than previously assumed.},

  abstract = {Background: Bovine TB (bTB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium bovis, is a major endemic disease affecting global cattle production. The key innate immune cell that first encounters the pathogen is the alveolar macrophage, previously shown to be substantially reprogrammed during intracellular infection by the pathogen. Here we use differential expression, and correlation- and interaction-based network approaches to analyse the host response to infection with M. bovis at the transcriptome level to identify core infection response pathways and gene modules. These outputs were then integrated with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets to enhance detection of genomic variants for susceptibility/resistance to M. bovis infection. Results: The host gene expression data consisted of RNA-seq data from bovine alveolar macrophages (bAM) infected with M. bovis at 24 and 48 hours post-infection (hpi) compared to non-infected control bAM. These RNA-seq data were analysed using three distinct computational pipelines to produce six separate gene sets: 1) DE genes filtered using stringent fold-change and P-value thresholds (DEG-24: 378 genes, DEG-48: 390 genes); 2) genes obtained from expression correlation networks (CON-24: 460 genes, CON-48: 416 genes); and 3) genes obtained from differential expression networks (DEN-24: 339 genes, DEN-48: 495 genes). These six gene sets were integrated with three bTB breed GWAS data sets by employing a new genomics data integration tool—gwinteR. Using GWAS summary statistics, this methodology enabled detection of 36, 102 and 921 prioritised SNPs for Charolais, Limousin and Holstein-Friesian, respectively. Conclusions: The results from the three parallel analyses showed that the three computational approaches could identify genes significantly enriched for SNPs associated with susceptibility/resistance to M. bovis infection. Results indicate distinct and significant overlap in SNP discovery, demonstrating that network-based integration of biologically relevant transcriptomics data can leverage substantial additional information from GWAS data sets. These analyses also demonstrated significant differences among breeds, with the Holstein-Friesian breed GWAS proving most useful for prioritising SNPS through data integration. Because the functional genomics data were generated using bAM from this population, this suggests that the genomic architecture of bTB resilience traits may be more breed-specific than previously assumed.},

  abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of human tuberculosis (hTB), is currently classed as the thirteenth leading cause of death worldwide. Mycobacterium bovis, a close evolutionary relative of M. tuberculosis, causes bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and is one of the most damaging infectious diseases to livestock agriculture. Previous studies have shown that the pathogenesis of bTB disease is comparable to hTB disease, and that the bovine and human alveolar macrophage (bAM and hAM, respectively) transcriptomes are extensively reprogrammed in response to infection with these intracellular mycobacterial pathogens. However, although M. bovis and M. tuberculosis share over 99\% identity at the genome level, the innate immune responses to these pathogens have been shown to be different in human or cattle hosts. In this study, a multi-omics integrative approach was applied to encompass functional genomics and GWAS data sets across the two primary hosts (Bos taurus and Homo sapiens) and both pathogens (M. bovis and M. tuberculosis). Four different experimental infection groups were used, each with parallel non-infected control cells: 1) bAM infected with M. bovis, 2) bAM infected with M. tuberculosis, 3) hAM infected with M. tuberculosis, and 4) human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) infected with M. tuberculosis. RNA-seq data from these experiments 24 hours post-infection (24 hpi) was analysed using three separate computational pipelines: 1) differentially expressed genes, 2) differential gene expression interaction networks, and 3) combined pathway analysis. The results of these analyses were then integrated with high-resolution bovine and human GWAS data sets to detect novel quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to mycobacterial infection and resilience to disease. Results from this study revealed common and unique response macrophage pathways for both pathogens and identified 32 genes (12 bovine and 20 human) significantly enriched for SNPs associated with disease resistance, the majority of which encode key components of the NF-κB signalling pathway and that also drive formation of the granuloma.},

Research suggests that T cell exhaustion, increased immunosuppressive cytokines, induction of regulatory T cells, and increased expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors may contribute to its pathogenesis. This study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular changes occurring in canine demodicosis using mass spectrometry and pathway enrichment analysis. The results indicate that endoplasmic reticulum stress is promoting canine demodicosis through regulation of three linked signalling pathways: eIF2, mTOR, and eIF4 and p70S6K. These pathways are involved in the modulation of Toll-like receptors, most notably TLR2, and have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of skin diseases in both dogs and humans. Moreover, these pathways are also implicated in the promotion of immunosuppressive M2 phenotype macrophages. Immunohistochemical analysis, utilizing common markers of dendritic cells and macrophages, verified the presence of M2 macrophages in canine demodicosis. The proteomic analysis also identified immunological disease, organismal injury and abnormalities, and inflammatory response as the most significant underlying diseases and disorders associated with canine demodicosis. This study demonstrates that Demodex mites, through ER stress, unfolded protein response and M2 macrophages contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment thereby assisting in their proliferation.},

High-resolution paleogenomic data sets now provide unprecedented opportunities to explore the development of animal agriculture across the world.

  abstract = {African cattle represent a complex mosaic of Bos taurus (taurine) and Bos indicus (zebu) with most breeds containing varying levels of taurine-zebu admixture. The two types of cattle diverged at least 500,000 years ago and significant genomic differences have accumulated since that time. One important evolutionary adaptation in certain African taurine populations is a genetically determined tolerance to infection by trypanosome parasites (Trypanosoma spp.), which are transmitted by infected tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) and cause African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) disease. The annual financial burden of AAT is approximately \$4.5 billion and AAT is one of the largest constraints to livestock rearing in the areas of sub-Saharan Africa with significant tsetse densities. The West African B. taurus N’Dama breed is trypanotolerant; they have the ability to control parasite loads and to limit disease pathology compared to trypanosusceptible zebu breeds. However, B. indicus or hybrid animals are generally larger, produce higher milk yields and are therefore favoured by many farmers. Using local ancestry analysis of genome-wide high-density SNP data, we have examined hybrid West African cattle populations to study subchromosomal admixture. These results are also integrated with gene expression data from bovine trypanosome infection studies to further explore the functional biology of differentially introgressed genomic regions.},

  abstract = {Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with trypanosome parasites (Trypanosoma spp.). These are transmitted by infected tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) and cause a similar disease in animals, known as African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT). AAT is one of the largest constraints to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa and causes a financial burden of approximately \$4.5 billion annually. Some African Bos taurus cattle populations have an important evolutionary adaptation known as trypanotolerance, a genetically determined tolerance of infection by trypanosome parasites (Trypanosoma spp.). Trypanotolerant African B. taurus N’Dama and trypanosusceptible Bos indicus Boran cattle responded in largely similar ways during trypanosome infection when gene expression was examined using blood, liver, lymph node, and spleen samples with peaks and troughs of gene expression differences following the cyclic pattern of parasitaemia exhibited during trypanosome infection. However, differences in response to infection between the two breeds were reflected in differential expression of genes related to the immune system such as those encoding antimicrobial peptides and cytokines, including, for example, the antimicrobial peptide encoding genes LEAP2, CATHL3, DEFB4A, and S100A7 and the cytokine genes CCL20, CXCL11, CXCL13, CXCL16, CXCL17, IL33, and TNFSF13B. In addition, transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood identified expression differences in genes relating to coagulation and iron homeostasis, which supports the hypothesis that the dual control of parasitaemia and the anaemia resulting from the innate immune response to trypanosome parasites is key to trypanotolerance and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Conservation of wild and livestock/aquaculture species aims at maximizing genetic diversity on the long-term, while selection programs focus mainly on genetic improvement in the next generation. Both genetic drift and selection can lead to high rates at which inbreeding increases if a small number of individuals contribute largely to subsequent generations. Increases in the rate of inbreeding would have negative consequences such as reductions of genetic variability and increased risk of inbreeding depression that may affect specific genomic regions and that can compromise the success of both conservation and selection programs. Traditionally, the control of inbreeding has been tracked by managing the relationships between individuals using pedigree records. With the advent of new genotyping and high-throughput sequencing technologies, obtaining more precise information about the relationships between individuals is now possible. While single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) chips or genotyping-by-sequencing data contain only a subset of the polymorphic variants available in a species, whole genome sequencing data provide access to complete information on all the variants of an individual. As a consequence, the estimation of coefficients to measure genetic variability may be affected by the type of data used for their estimation. During the post-genomics era, a variety of methods to characterize the levels of genetic diversity from genomic information within and between populations have been developed. These are related to the estimation of the selection signature and population structure or coefficients to determine the increase in inbreeding such as effective population size. However, under this new genomic perspective, methods and concepts need to be revised. In parallel to the development of genomic tools, traditional and new strategies to control inbreeding to simultaneously target conservation of genetic diversity and genetic improvement need to be developed or accommodated to the new context. The availability of genomic information opens up possibilities to include genome wide marker information in prediction of total breeding values and to obtain higher genetic gains through genomic selection but controlling the increase of the rate of inbreeding is also necessary to ensure the viability of the programs.},

  abstract = {Domestic cattle have a key economic role in African societies, providing an important source of mobile wealth through supply of meat, milk, cowhide, fuel, transport, and traction. The phenotypic diversity of African cattle reflects adaptation to a wide range of agroecological conditions and complex patterns of admixture between the humpless Bos taurus (taurine) and humped Bos indicus (zebu) subspecies, which share a common ancestor 150-500 thousand years ago. Human migration and trade from Asia have left a peak of zebu nuclear ancestry in East Africa and most cattle populations across the continent have a hybrid genetic composition. Notwithstanding this, all African cattle possess taurine mitochondrial haplotypes, even populations with significant zebu nuclear ancestry. In this regard, the efficient functioning of the mitochondrion relies on a network of biochemical interactions between the products of 37 mitochondrial genes and more than one thousand nuclear genes; therefore, admixed African cattle represent ideal populations for evaluating mitonuclear interactions and mismatch between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Using high-density SNP array data from 18 different cattle populations, including ten African admixed breeds, we find strong evidence for mitonuclear coevolution in hybrid African cattle with significant retention of Bos taurus alleles at mitochondrially-targeted nuclear genes, particularly those genes with products that directly interact with mtDNA-encoded protein subunits in OXPHOS and ribosomal complexes, or that have functions in mtDNA replication. We also show that subspecific local ancestry varies substantially across the genomes of admixed populations, with a marked signal of taurine ancestry at the major histocompatibility (MHC) gene cluster, which likely reflects adaptation to infectious disease challenges facing African livestock. Our results demonstrate that African admixed cattle represent an excellent comparative model for studying the phenotypic consequences of mitonuclear mismatch and genomic introgression in humans and other large mammals.},

Despite extensive admixture, all African cattle possess taurine mitochondrial haplotypes, even populations with significant zebu biparental and male uniparental nuclear ancestry. This has been interpreted as the result of human-mediated dispersal ultimately stemming from zebu bulls imported from South Asia during the last three millennia. Here, we assess whether ancestry at mitochondrially targeted nuclear genes in African admixed cattle is impacted by mitonuclear functional interactions. Using high-density SNP data, we find evidence for mitonuclear coevolution across hybrid African cattle populations with a significant increase of taurine ancestry at mitochondrially targeted nuclear genes. Our results, therefore, support the hypothesis of incompatibility between the taurine mitochondrial genome and the zebu nuclear genome.},

Despite extensive admixture, all African cattle possess taurine mitochondrial haplotypes, even populations with significant zebu biparental and male uniparental nuclear ancestry. This has been interpreted as the result of a human-mediated dispersal ultimately stemming from zebu bulls imported from South Asia during the last three millennia. Here we assess whether ancestry at mitochondrially-targeted nuclear genes in African admixed cattle is impacted by mitonuclear functional interactions. Using high-density SNP data, we find evidence for mitonuclear coevolution across hybrid African cattle populations with a significant increase of taurine ancestry at mitochondrially-targeted nuclear genes. Our results, therefore, support the hypothesis of incompatibility between the taurine mitochondrial genome and the zebu nuclear genome.},

  abstract = {Criollo cattle, descendants of animals brought by Iberian colonists to the Americas, have been subject to centuries of natural and human-mediated selection in novel tropical agroecological zones. Consequently, these breeds have evolved distinct characteristics such as resistance to disease and exceptional heat tolerance. In addition to European taurine (Bos taurus) ancestry, it has been proposed that gene flow from African taurine and Asian zebu (Bos indicus) cattle has shaped the ancestry of Criollo cattle. In this study, we analysed Criollo breeds from Colombia and Venezuela using whole genome sequencing data to examine population structure and admixture at very high resolution. We did not detect evidence of African taurine admixture in Criollo cattle; however, there was evidence of longstanding zebu ancestry in one breed (Hartón del Valle). In addition, we detected selection signatures associated with a myriad of adaptive traits, revealing genes linked to thermotolerance, reproduction, fertility, immunity, and distinct coat and skin coloration traits. This study underscores the remarkable adaptability of Criollo cattle and highlights the genetic richness and potential of these breeds in the face of climate change, habitat flux, and disease challenges. Further research is warranted to leverage these findings for more effective and sustainable cattle breeding programmes.},

  abstract = {Criollo cattle, descendants of animals brought by Iberian settlers to the Americas, are a group of breeds that have been subjected to centuries of natural and sometimes human-mediated selection in novel agroecological zones. This has resulted in populations that are uniquely adapted to the diverse environments found in Latin America and the Caribbean. Criollo cattle exhibit distinct characteristics such as a resistance to disease and exceptional heat tolerance. In addition to European taurine (Bos taurus) ancestry, it has been proposed that Criollo cattle have experienced gene flow from African taurine and Asian zebu (Bos indicus) populations. In this study we analysed three Criollo breeds (Blanco Orejinegro and Hartón del Valle from Colombia , and Limonero from Venezuela) using whole genome sequencing data to examine population structure and admixture at very high resolution. We also examined selection signatures associated with a myriad of adaptive traits, revealing genes linked to thermotolerance, reproduction, fertility, and immunity. Our results also provided evidence of artificial selection, particularly for distinct coat and skin coloration traits. We did not detect evidence for historical African taurine admixture in Criollo cattle; however, there was evidence of uniform admixture between the Hartón del Valle breed and zebu cattle. This study underscores the remarkable adaptability of Criollo cattle, driven by both natural and human-mediated selection. It highlights the genetic richness and potential of these breeds in the face of climate change, habitat flux, and disease challenges. Further research is warranted to validate and leverage these findings for more effective and sustainable cattle breeding programmes.},
